What is your "dream" GIS/tech job?
My dream GIS job is to work with various types of projects. I want to be able to work with government agencies as well as private. I want to strengthen my coding skills. I am 22 years old so I know I have a long way to go but I have created python scripts that I have used at work. Right now, I am working part-time at the City of La Habra. The script I made for them is enabled by windows task manager and creates a back-up file geodatabase that planners can connect their QGIS to. 

What GIS applications or technologies excite you most?
I get excited about creativity. I love bringing graphic design and coding into GIS applications such as model builders, creating the hubsite and etc.

What GIS skills/techniques or non-GIS hobbies would you like to focus on after this semester ends?
In class, I actually asked you if we could still have access to the youtube recording. I genuinely appreciate you recording and allowing us to go back to this material. I am going to re-visit the python codes for remote sensing . Some non-GIS hobbies I will focus on is baking and cooking. I want to take a cake decorating class. 
I also registered for a web design in the summer.
