What was your favorite part of the class?
Thank you so much for not making the class super difficult especially the final because the content is very important but hard to grasp so quickly. That's why I asked during class to be able to revisit the youtube videos and I am thankful to you for allowing that. 

What was your least favorite part of the class?
The only least favorite would be to have assignments due midnight on Sunday. This gives me more time to finish the work. 

Do you have any suggestions for how the instructor could improve the class experience for future students?
I like the class. I like the exposure to GitHub. I think it's good. Is there a way to use the remote sensing python in arcpy?
